Miscellaneous MEL scripts used at SphereFrame

You are free to download and use these scripts for your own projects. However, this is not an actively developed project. We primarily use this repository to distribute and track changes to our scripts. Most of these scripts are short and simple functions that help speed up specific tasks. Basic documentation is provided for these scripts.
